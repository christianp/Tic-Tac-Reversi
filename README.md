Tic-Tac Othello
===============

A simple game based on Noughts and Crosses with additions from Othello.

Based on @sebble's version.

Instructions
------------

Click on a square to mark it with your symbol.
The first player to mark an entire row, column, or proper diagonal with their symbol wins.

Reversi rules apply - if you put your symbol on both ends of a line of the other guy's symbol, the whole line gets switched to your symbol.
